  <b><h1>Notes from Stage 0, Unit 1</h1></b>

<p><b><big>Major Concepts</big></b></p>
The world wide web started in the early 1990s and now consists of over <b><em>30 billion pages!</em></b> <br>
The web is a collection of html documents.  Hyperlinks connect all pages like a web. <br>

HTML <em>(hyper text markup language)</em> is the heart of the web.  It is made up of: <br>
- text content (what we see) <br>
- markup (what it looks like or how it is arranged) <br>
- references to other documents (images, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--UhAMQo7RY&feature=youtu.be">videos</a>, etc.) <br>
- links to other pages (such as this <a href=www.cnn.com>CNN</a>)

<p><b><big>Today's key lessons</big></b></p>

We covered the use of Tags.  Tags are used to instruct a computer what to do.<br>  Most tags consist of an opening and closing tag, but some do not.  These exceptions are called Void Tags. One example of a Void tag is the Image tag.
<br>
<br>Another interesting point we learned about the use of images is that it is required (<em>as well as courteous</em>) to provide a text description of the image in the event of a broken image or to aid the visually impaired.   I've attempted to test that concept here:<br>

<br>
<br>

<p><b><big>In Closing</big></b></p>
While we learned a lot of tidbits regarding href attributes vs. source attributes; inline vs. block elements; and the main components of an html document (the Doctype, Head & Body), it is reassuring to know that not<em> all</em> of these details must be committed to memory. Many basic html commands are easily found online.  
I proved this by searching for help in adjusting the font size <b><small>here</small></b> and elswehere throughout the document.
